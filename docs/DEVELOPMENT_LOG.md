# Development Log

This is the chronological record of development work, including failures. Add a
new entry for each meaningful experiment or configuration change; do not erase
failed attempts after they are understood.

## 2026-09-02 — Initial Mac inventory and connection check

### Scope

Read-only discovery only. No software was installed, no remote configuration was
changed, and no motor command was sent.

### Mac workspace

- **Success:** Located the project workspace at
  `/Users/animesh/Animesh/Project 2.0/Echora Robo`.
- **Success:** Confirmed that `AGENTS.md` was the only existing project file.
- **Observation:** The workspace was not a Git repository at the time of the
  check.
- **Success:** Confirmed the Mac is Apple silicon (`arm64`) and its active LAN
  address is `192.168.1.26/24`.

### Remote connectivity

- **Failure:** SSH to the Jetson at `seth@192.168.1.48` failed before
  authentication with `No route to host`.
- **Failure:** SSH to the EV3 at `robot@192.168.1.25` failed before
  authentication with `No route to host`.
- **Interpretation:** The supplied passwords were not tested. Although the Mac
  is on the expected `192.168.1.0/24` LAN, neither target answered the SSH
  connection attempt. Likely causes include a powered-off or disconnected
  device, a changed DHCP address, Wi-Fi client isolation, or SSH not listening.

### Next check

Confirm that both devices are powered on and connected to the same LAN, then
confirm their current IP addresses from the device screens/router. Repeat the
read-only SSH inventory before installing or changing anything.
